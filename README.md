# Space-Assault
SPACE ASSAULT is a story based multi stagged game developed in python using pygame module.
## Modules used:
main modules used in its development were:
1. Pygame (for graphics handling, logic building and organizing)
2. time (for countdown etc.)
3. pygame.mixer (for music play and sound effects)
## Modules in this game:
1. stage.py (contain all data about how to build stage)
2. enemy.py (contain class for building enemy)
3. player.py (contain class for building player {shooting logic included} )
4. screen.py (contain all logic for start screen, game pause, instructions etc.)
5. Game.py (actual game with 10 stage setup)
6. main.py (runnable module to play game along with start screen and ending)
## Merits:
1. No game engine was used.
2. All animations are coded no video file was used.
3. All graphics and sounds are free and available publically.
4. Light weight game.
5. Use modules to build everything. Hence, adding new stages is not an issue.
## Flaws:
being my first project it:
1. lack proper variable names in some modules
2. code is not as clean as it could have been
3. there is redundency in code.
## How to run:
To start the game just run main.py file
